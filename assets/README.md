## Acceptance Criteria
```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```

## Tests
To test this, you will need to first open the terminal and download sequlize & mysql from npm. Once you do that update the .env file to your information.  To run the server in the terminal put 'node server'.  After this, you will want to upload your seed data.  In the terminal you will run 'node seeds'.  Once this is done you can go to insomina to test the get routes, the put routes and the delete routes.
